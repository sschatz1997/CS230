Objectives:

1. File I/O: Read/Write, write over, append

2. Review of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism.

Write a program that has a base and derived classes and then uses them through a menu driven to populate their values and store them in the file for later retrieval.

When the program is ran again, it should retrieve any stored information and offer the possibility to append new data to the persistant data file.

An example will be shown in class before the due date.

Upload your source code, data file, executable and a lab report.
